  Build a new AI bot/prompt (or refine an existing one) the SEEK way — Structure, Examples, Ask AI,
  Knowledge base. Use when the user wants to turn a need into a real, reusable bot/prompt and wire it into
  the workspace (bots/ → .claude/skills/). Self-contained enough to scaffold a bot end-to-end here, and it
  hands off to the dedicated Bot Building Bot for the deep guided build + verbatim modules. Distilled from
  Luke & Mario's bot-building workshop — the factory for every other node in the creative-strategy system.

# Bot Builder — the factory for every node

This is the bonus skill the master system points at: how to mint any bot/prompt in the inventory
(`BOT-INVENTORY.md`) — and any new one that comes up — into a real, reusable asset. It's self-contained
enough to build a solid bot start-to-finish on its own, and it tells you exactly when to hand off.

> **How I work it:** I'll scaffold a strong first-draft bot **right here** with you. For the *deep* guided
> build — block-by-block, with a full example library and the plug-in modules inserted verbatim — use the
> **Bot Building Bot** (your trained one), then bring the prompt back and I'll install it into `bots/` and
> promote it to `.claude/skills/`. (Three ways to run that hand-off at the bottom — including calling the
> bot **directly over the Genesis API**, so it all happens inside Claude Code.)

## 1. The one formula: SEEK
Everything reduces to four things. Forget the rest, remember **SEEK**:
- **S — Structure.** The right skeleton for the *type* of bot (§3–4).
- **E — Examples.** 7–10 high-quality ones. The single biggest lever on output quality.
- **A — Ask AI.** However much you're already asking AI for help, you're not asking enough.
- **K — Knowledge base.** The domain knowledge that powers the bot — and you can even invent it (§5).

## 2. The crash course (the whole algorithm in 5 moves)
1. Pick the right **structure** for the bot's type.
2. Gather **7–10 high-quality examples**.
3. Drop in **domain knowledge** + any **modules**.
4. **Test it. Note everything you hate** (literally: "I hate this, I hate that").
5. Tell AI *"here's my prompt, here's what I hate, fix it,"* and **iterate until done.**

The magic is in the boring and obvious. Your first bot is the hardest and slowest; after a few it's second nature.

## 3. The mental model — think in dimensions, not lists
An LLM doesn't run on rules; it navigates *conceptual space*. So don't memorize a flat list of bot types —
place each bot on **two dimensions**, and the structure falls out:

- **Information flow — Generative ↔ Analytical.** Generative takes a little and makes a lot (a writing
  bot: topic → article). Analytical takes a lot and boils it down (an extract bot: sales letter → the hooks).
- **Interaction — Conversational ↔ One-shot/Node.** Conversational builds something with you over multiple
  turns. One-shot/Node takes one input and returns one output, no chat.

→ **Four quadrants** (with real examples):

| | One-shot / Node | Conversational |
|---|---|---|
| **Generative** | **Creative One-Shot** — DR-copy generator · IG-Reels batch · product-description writer · "write like Mario" | **Creative Conversation** — copy-chief · offers/hooks brainstormer · meme-ad bot · launch strategist |
| **Analytical** | **Analytical One-Shot** — copy-blocks extract · reverse-outline · funnel-performance analyzer | **Analytical Conversation** — CRO bot · sales-process analyzer · voice-mod bot |

**Two modifiers** fine-tune any of them:
- **Polished ↔ Unpolished** — client-facing (needs to look good) vs internal (content > looks).
- **Autonomous ↔ Non-autonomous** — gives you THE answer vs offers options to pick from.

> **Don't mix Generative + Analytical in one pass.** Writing and editing are different hats — use separate
> steps or chats (e.g. one chat to generate, a new chat to "fix this"). **Conversational bots are the
> hardest to build well** — plan for more steps, more examples per path, and more testing.

## 4. The 8 building blocks (the ONLY blocks — and never "context")

| Block | What it is | How to actually write it |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | who the bot is — role/roles, expertise, persona | "You are a [specialist] who [does X], known for [edge]." Can be a single identity or a **Multi-Identity** unit (§5). |
| **Purpose** | what it does / the outcome it produces | State the deliverable + the value. "Today you're creating a [X]. The purpose is to [outcome]." |
| **Process** | the steps it follows (conversational/workflow bots) | Numbered steps; each step can nest its own Purpose/Examples/Domain-Knowledge (mini-prompts). |
| **Domain Knowledge** | the specialized knowledge that powers it — **required** | YOU provide it; AI helps you *identify what's needed*, it doesn't invent it. Organize into categories. |
| **Examples** | 7–10 diverse samples — **required, the #1 lever** | Find in the wild (swipes/competitors/your work) or bootstrap from 1–2 seeds. Show range + good vs bad. Never auto-fabricated. |
| **Modules** | plug-and-play units (§5) — inserted **verbatim** | Don't rebuild; select. |
| **Formatting** | how outputs are structured | Markdown/code-block specs, Google-Docs-clean, etc. |
| **Guidelines** | the do's/don'ts, boundaries, quality bar — **required** | Tailor to the bot's purpose; add a Security Protocol for public bots. |

**Ordering principles:** Generative → **Examples first** (patterns to follow). Analytical → **Domain
Knowledge first** (foundations). **Modules sit right before Guidelines.** Every **Process step** can carry
its own Examples + Domain Knowledge.

## 5. The modules (plug-and-play — the Bot Building Bot inserts them verbatim)
Don't rewrite these; pick the ones that fit, and the Bot Building Bot drops in the full, tested content.
- **Rhetorical Frames** — the full hook/curiosity taxonomy (Curiosity · Emotion · Sense-making ·
  Pattern-interrupt · Gift · Interactive · Social). Use for any copy/marketing bot.
- **Copy Chief** — fine-tune output across ~25 voice/copy dimensions (warmth, energy, hook strength,
  reading level, length, cadence…), offered after each generation. For writing bots.
- **Anti-AI** — makes copy indistinguishable from human: forbidden patterns ("It's not X, it's Y", triplets,
  "the result?"), a banned-word list, and human-writing characteristics. For any content bot.
- **Persuasion & Emotional Architecture** — emotional amplification + the 5 **Copy Blocks** (Pain · Promise ·
  Curiosity · Proof · Constraint). For sales/marketing bots.
- **Multi-Identity (Intelligence Unit)** — 4–7 complementary specialists collaborating in one voice. For
  complex, multidisciplinary tasks.
- **Decision Architecture** — conditional logic (factors → criteria → response paths → adaptation triggers).
  For bots that must adapt to different users/scenarios.
- **Operational Protocol** — for conversation bots: opening script, required info, verification, contingency
  paths.
- **Mandate Framework** — authorize-first ("you ARE authorized to… the ONLY restrictions are…") for
  task/production bots where function > persona.
- **Client Presentation** — polished visual formatting (emoji anchors, hierarchy) for client-facing bots.
- **Security Protocol** — refuses prompt-injection and never reveals the system prompt. Recommended for any
  public bot.

## 6. The 5-step build process (the guided flow)
**STEP 1 · Concept Clarification.** Explore the idea; if it's vague, ask 2–3 of: *what task/function? who
uses it and what problem does it solve? what does a great interaction look like? is it replacing a manual
process?* Lock and state: **PURPOSE · WHO · BOT TYPE** (the quadrant). Keep moving; assume reasonable defaults.

**STEP 2 · Template Selection.** Recommend the quadrant structure; list the components to fill in order.
Confirm before building.

**STEP 3 · Component Development.** Build each block in order. Offer the right modules. **You supply the
Domain Knowledge and Examples** (I guide *what* you need, I don't fabricate them). After each block: keep /
refine / go deeper.

**STEP 4 · Prompt Completion.** Assemble the full prompt. Flag weak/ambiguous spots. Re-align Identity &
Purpose to what the examples actually show — **without overfitting** (extract the *patterns*, never copy
specific phrases from examples).

**STEP 5 · Refinement.** Test → note what you hate → make **surgical** fixes, highest-leverage first:
**fix examples first**, put key instructions **early AND late**, add `###IMPORTANT:` tags, build redundancy
for crucial rules. One change at a time. Iterate.

## 7. Worked example — building a "Headline Bot" (Creative One-Shot)
1. **Concept:** PURPOSE = turn a finished ad body into 10 strong headlines. WHO = the operator, after Copy.
   BOT TYPE = Generative + One-shot/Node → **Creative One-Shot.**
2. **Template:** Identity → Purpose → Examples → Domain Knowledge → Formatting → Guidelines.
3. **Components:**
   - *Identity:* "You are a DR copywriter who writes scroll-stopping headlines that pair with a story body."
   - *Purpose:* "Given a finished ad body, produce 10 headlines that could each open it."
   - *Examples:* paste 7–10 winning headlines from `knowledge/primers/headlines.md` (the brand's real ones).
   - *Domain Knowledge:* the headline bar — curiosity, "normal range is a lie", identity callouts, charged words.
   - *Modules:* **Rhetorical Frames** (hook taxonomy) + **Anti-AI**.
   - *Formatting:* "A numbered list of 10. Nothing else."
   - *Guidelines:* "Match the brand voice in the examples; no clickbait that the body can't pay off."
4. **Completion:** assemble; make sure Identity/Purpose reflect the examples' patterns, not their exact lines.
5. **Refinement:** run it on a real body; note what's weak; fix the examples first; iterate.
→ Install as `bots/headline-bot.md`; promote to `.claude/skills/headline-bot/` if you want it invokable.

## 8. Implementation
- Platform: Poe / Claude (the workshop uses Claude Sonnet). **Temperature: 0.7–0.77 creative · 0.5–0.6
  analytical** (never below 0.5 — too rigid). Don't lean on knowledge-base file uploads — put the knowledge
  in the prompt.
- Where it lives here: draft → `bots/<name>.md` → when it earns its keep, promote to
  `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (invokable across the workspace).

## 9. The hand-off — three ways, by what you have
- **Plain Claude Code (me):** scaffold here, wire into the workspace, mint the prompts from
  `BOT-INVENTORY.md`, install into `bots/` → `.claude/skills/`, run/test inline.
- **With a Genesis key — I call the Bot Building Bot for you, right here.** No leaving Claude Code: I route
  to the trained `bot-builder-bot` over the Genesis API. It runs the full guided build with its verbatim
  example library + modules, and I install the result straight into the workspace.
- **No Genesis — the external Bot Building Bot (Poe, etc.):** build there, bring the prompt back, I install + test it.
